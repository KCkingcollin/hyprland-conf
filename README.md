# KC's Reasonable Hyprland Configs
This repo is for the default configs I plan to use in my upcoming castle-sell project, it also has some scripts and services related to the theme.

The code in this repo can be used as a standalone thing, and it can even be used to install everything automatically to a arch based distro, it'll be constantly tested against both a fresh arch install and A Endeavor OS installation with cinnamon installed before getting pushed to stable.

#### For more information, and [installation](https://github.com/KCkingcollin/kcs-reasonable-configs/wiki/Installation) instructions, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/KCkingcollin/kcs-reasonable-configs/wiki). 

I'm trying to make everything easy ish to edit in case someone new uses this repo, so let me know if I can change anything to make it easier to mess around with.
